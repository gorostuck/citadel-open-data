This project was awarded **third place** in the European Regional of the Eurpean Regional Data Open organised by Citadel and Correlation One. 

## Background
Gentrification is the process of changing the character of a neighbourhood through the influx of
more affluent residents and businesses. Although at first glance it seems very positive, it is
actually a controversial topic in politics and urban planning. It is unquestionable that a
neighbourhood can benefit from physical improvements of its buildings or the creation of new
business; however, gentrification normally comes at the price of the displacement (or
replacement) of the working-class population by the new middle class as the cost of living in the
area tends to increase.

## Problem statement
Our goal was to use census data for every tract in the New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA
Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) in order to discover and analyze patterns related to the
gentrification process.
